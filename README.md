# Embedded-Systems-Assignment-2

What works:

- Command parser
- Some examples for position control: R5, R50, R100
- Timing constraints met, Interrupts and Threads used.

What doesn't work:

- Hardware issues with the motor: the motor clicks, and the rotor rubs on the PCB
- Speed control not functional due to inexact velocity calculations however the control system works: refer to line 380

How to use:

- Supports the normal commands detailed in the spec sheet
